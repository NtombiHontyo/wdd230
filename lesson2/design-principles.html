        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <h4>Brandz</h4>
        <a href="https://brandzz.co.za">Brandz.co.za</a>

        <p>
          This is one of my favourite design principles as I am a strong
          believer of simplicity. The page I chose is a webpage for online
          shopping. It is important for such pages to highlight the products
          that they are trying to sell. One way to achieve this is by making
          good use of white space and clear design in order to make the shopping
          experience straightforward for the user. There are no backgrounds that
          will dull out the key features of the products as illustrated in the
          above picture. The shape, colour and texture of the shoes, clothes,
          etc can be easily discerned. And if there is anything that the shopper
          would need to do, it is identified, such as viewing the shopping cart,
          it can be done without trouble. Truly a pleasurable shopping
          experience!

        <h3>P.A.R.C - Alignment</h3>
        <h4>Netflix</h4>
        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix.com</a>
        <img src="images/alignment.png" alt="Illustration of Alignment" />
        <p>
          Alignment is an important design principle in web design. Web design
          is not a deep abstract art and therefore alignment is needed to help
          the viewer navigate the webpage with their eyes. For example with the
          page I chose; Netflix, because each program available is aligned with
          the adjacent ones it forces the viewer to give each program equal
          consideration, and to spend their focus on each instead having to move
          their eyes up and down and sideways. They simply move in a straight
          line as though one is reading. As humans we typically dislike chaos
          and alignment is just one way to eliminate it in the browsing world.

        <h3>P.A.R.C - Repetition</h3>
        <h4>Property24</h4>
        <a href="https://www.property24.com/">Property24.com</a>
        <img src="images/repetition.png" alt="Illustration of Alignment" />
        <p>
          When designing a webpage, some items must repeat the same theme. The
          reason for this, is that it assists in navigating to the key elements
          that are important to take note of. For example in the webpage for
          Property24, a webpage for property to buy or rent, the two key
          important elements for the potential homebuyer is location and price.
          They are written using the same font colour, font size and within the
          same position. When looking for the price you look for the colour blue
          which is easy to find. Repetition helps web viewers to recognize
          content quickly without doing much finding.

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose of the Durban Chamber of Commerce site is to provide its
          members with a website to view all the relevant details about the
          chamber as well an opportunity for potential members to join. It also
          gives them an opportunity to interact more extensively about their own
          business interests and offers available within their subscription. It
          will provide the visitors of the site with an in-depth tour of the
          history of the City of Durban in terms of trade and industry. Both
          members and potential members will leave the site with their questions
          answered about the business demographics of Durban.
